## Usage

This FEM can get used with the Server State's client-base client. To install it, open the FEM Manager and search for [FEM-Name].
Then, click install, and your FEM immediately gets installed and be ready to use.

After that, just apply the FEM in a widget on one of your dashboards using the Widget configuration screen by clicking Select FEM and selecting [FEM-Name] from the list.

## Development

For development, this project uses the Server State CLI (@server-state/cli on npm).
As a local installation inside the project will do, run:
```npm install```
inside your project folder and you are ready to contribute.

By running npm start, the FEM development environment will open in your standard browser where you can inspect the FEM in various environments.

To build a .fem file after you're finished, run npm run build, and an index.fem gets built for you.
You can then distribute the FEM to a FEM registry of your choice or privately, e.g., for internal company usage.
